# Design Patterns
For a long time, I wanted to learn more about different design patterns.
As reference I try to use [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object Oriented Software](https://www.bookdepository.com/Design-Patterns-Erich-Gamma/9780201633610?ref=grid-view&qid=1618810264956&sr=1-1)
 and the Tutorials provided by [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/typescript)
