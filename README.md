# Sharing is Caring ðŸŒ±

## What is this repository all about? ðŸ¤”
The repository "Sharing is Caring" is all about constant and small progress. In the world of 
software development there is always more than enough to learn. Sometimes you have the feeling, that you 
should be master of all of these new technologies. Since I often have the feeling, that my work is not good enough
I wanted to start contributing to the open source community. I think, that software and code should be used
to solve real world problems and not only fictional ones from the school bock. In this repository I try to reach 
two goals. The first goal is to share my learning publicly. My Code will not be great at the beginning, but the only
way to really master a craft is to do it on a daily basis and be open for constructive feedback. The second goal I try 
to reach is to provide scripts and helpers, which helped me in my daily life. Because sometimes, small helpers are much 
better than huge sophisticated programs.

## What will you find here? ðŸŽ¯
In the beginning, I want to lay my focus on two things. The first thing I want to tackle until August 2021 is Analytics 
with R. Since I try to track and analyze my own behavior, it would be interessting, to be able to provide templates and 
brief code snippets for everybody to do the same. The second topic is to get Ready for Coding interviews. For this I want
to learn more about Design Patterns, Algorithms and Data Structures.
